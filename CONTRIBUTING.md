### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation]()).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?


#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to muahmad710@gmail.com

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

### Code Contribution
- Agenix is for all, from all. Your contributions keep the project going forward!
- To contribute fork the repository.
- Now clone your local copy using:
```
git clone <url>
```
- Make a new branch using:
```
git checkout -b <branch>
```
- Make your changes and create a Pull Request.
- Wait for your changes to be merged!


#### How to Make Good Code Contributions
- Name things properly, while making a new branch, use a prefix like tools, docs, feat etc. Followed by the name.
- An example would be feat/adding-support-for-supabase
- Follow the PR template while creating the PR.
- Wait for your PR to be reviewed, follow up on the reviews.
